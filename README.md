# Import-ExportData
An interactive visualization of import and export data between foreign countries and states

The code in this repository was my contribution to a group project. It consists of an interactive bar chart that responds to user input using the javascript library D3.js. I'm currently changing things around and trying to make my own version of the project, so the product is not yet finished. 

Still need to implement an interactive pie chart and interactive map.
