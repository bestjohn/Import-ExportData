    <ol><h2>Introduction</h2></ol>
    
    <p>The main goal of this project is to visualize the data of the U.S. exports and imports through which any individual can get to know and investigate more about the goods and services that are being shipped from the U.S. to foreign countries also entering the U.S. from foreign countries. As a part of this, we accessed foreign trade data from United States census.gov website. With the prior and extended knowledge on D3.js, we team of 3, have written the code in such a way to get the U.S. state map and other associated charts which are completely interactive with a touch of fun in our project. </p>
    
    <ol><h2>Design Process</h2></ol>
    
    <p>As a first step in the design process, we understood all the requirements of this project and then planned to come up with a layout of our webpage. Finally after undergoing pros and cons of every design and visualization chart also considering time constraint of this project, we came up with the following layout.
The layout consists of checkboxes for years from 2013-2016 and radio buttons for trading options (imports and exports) followed by countries and commodities. And then we have radio buttons for first layer and second layer. First layer: where we can view small picture of the countries categorized based on region wise in the world , Second layer: where we can view big picture of all the countries in every region.
Then we have a state map with tooltip functionality of the United States including Alaska and Hawaii and excluding territories in the map also in the dataset. Subsequently when a user click on a particular state after choosing the options from checkboxes and radio buttons, a pie chart will be displayed showing either the countries or commodities based on the amount of imports and exports. At the bottom of the page, we have three charts (bar chart, pie chart and line chart) which are interactive with each other which gives more clear cut idea on the U.S. foreign trade from the years 2013-2016.
We kept changing the layout and data structure either because we figured out what we wanted is not logical or new ideas occur to us. For example, about the fun part, we wanted to implement the pac man to, for instance, make it walk through the way from the most amount of exports to the least amount of ones.
