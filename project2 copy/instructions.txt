Visualization that investigates imports and exports to and from US states to other countries
	Will enable user to investigate and answer the following questions:
		What are the most popular exports from the US?
		Which countries are the most popular trading partners?
		What imports/exports are more popular in different parts of the US?
		Where is trade increasing or decreasing?
		What are some unexpected imports/exports?

The visualization will make use of maps as well as other charts.

Interface will start with a meaningful ‘overview’ of the data. The user will be able to interact with the overview and make specific selections and see additional information.
